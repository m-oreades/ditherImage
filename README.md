This script converts an image to a dithered version, eliminating large areas or lines of solid color.

Resolution is ok above 200 pixels wide. Details really begin to degrade when the image width is less than 100 pixels.

Intended application:
to convert an image with gradient to a two color pattern suitable for knitting. The dithering eliminates continuous runs of any color, preventing hanging yarns on the reverse side.
This approach is suitable for larger scale patterns, possibly for a sweater, or a tube knit with very small gauge needles.
